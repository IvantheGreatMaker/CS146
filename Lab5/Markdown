Is BST take in the root, minimum int, and maximum int
  if the root is null
    return true ( if there are no nodes then it's a valid empty tree)
  else if the root is less than the lower limit or more than the upper limit
    return false
  then call itself checking the left side with the max of as the root, and (use an AND operator so one false makes this an invalid BST)  call itself checking the right side with the root as the minimum
