Idea: Breath first search
Base case: if root is null
  return null

create resulting list of lists
create queue

add root to queue

while queue has nodes in it
  get level size by the amount of values in queue
  create list for nodes in leve

  for every node in the level size
    add the node to the level list
    add the children of the node to the queue

  add the level list to the list of level lists
return list of lists
#(we needed level size to make sure we only add in the values at this level into the level list)
