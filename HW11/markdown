if pixel is already the color 
    return the array
    m is row
    n is column
    old color is the original pixel color
    create a queue and add the pixel cordinate as an ordered pair 

    while the queue has a pixel in it
        take out the cordinate

        if the corinate is not original pixel color 
            skip the next steps

        check if has a neighbor in all four sides then add that to the queue if it has one
